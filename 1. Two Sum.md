The question simply asks us to find a pair that corrosponds to a target, the intuitive approach suggests we simply iterate over the vector and for evey value, we look for it's corrosponding 'target - value' in the vector and return the indexes of first such pair that comes across. 
The complexity of this approach will be big o(n^2) as in the worst possible case we might have to go through every value of the array and for each value, we will have to iterate over the remaining array to find a pair that corrosponds to the given sum. 

To overcome this problem, we use a hashmap. 
In simple terms, we create a map that stores values and their indexes, and as we iterate over value of every element in the vector, we check if our map already has the 'target-value' and the moment we get such pair, we return the corrsoponding indexes. 

Here is the code with comments to help understand better: 
```
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        unordered_map<int,int>a;   //create the map that stores value and it's corrosponding index
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){  //iterate over the given vector
            if(a.find(target-nums[i])!= a.end()){  //if we find 'target - value' in our map, we simply return the indexes
                return {i, a[target-nums[i]]};  // 'i' is the index at which we currently are and 'a[target-nums[i]' is the index that corrosponded to 'target-nums[i]' value
            }
            a[nums[i]]=i;  //in every iteration we simply add the value and index to our map
        }
        
        return {};  //if no such pair found, return empty vector
    }
