Logically the very first observation that can substantially reduce the complexity of this problem is when we realise that all anagrams of a given string, when sorted, will return the same string. 
For example if we are given 5 strings that are anagrams of each other as follows:

s1: aryan
s2: rayan
s3: nayra
s4: ryana
s5: aryna

when we sort these strings we get 

sorted s1: aanry
sorted s2: aanry
sorted s3: aanry
sorted s4: aanry
sorted s5: aanry

which means anagrams, when sorted will return the same string. 
So naturally we can create an unordered map that has a string as key and a vector of strings as its corrosponding value. Then as we iterate over our given vector of string, we extract each string and make a copy of it after sorting it, then we push our original string into our map with sorted string as key. This will ensure that all anagrams are grouped together as they will be pushed into the same key value (i.e the string in sorted order).
In the end we simply iterate over our map and push every map value (vector of string)  into ans (vector of vectorof string ) and we return the ans.
Here is code with comments for a better understanding:

```
vector<vector<string>> groupAnagrams(vector<string>& strs) {
        unordered_map<string, vector<string>>m;
        vector<vector<string>>ans;
        
        for(auto x: strs){
            string temp = x;   //store the copy of every string we iterate over in x
            sort(x.begin(), x.end()); // sort the copy and use this as the key for our map
            m[x].push_back(temp);  // push the original string corrosponding to sorted version of the string in map
        }
        
        for(auto itr: m){
            vector<string> temp2= itr.second; 
            ans.push_back(temp2); //push all anagrams of a given string in ans
        }
        
        return ans;
        
    }
```
