The solution is as simple as picking up 2 numbers with maximum values, and 2 numbers with the minimum values and subtracting their products. So we can easily use 2 heaps, one to find the largest and second largest values, another to find the smallest and second smallest value and return the difference of their products. 


```
int maxProductDifference(vector<int>& nums) {
         priority_queue<int>maxh(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>>minh(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        
        int a = maxh.top();
        maxh.pop();
        int b = maxh.top();
        int c = minh.top();
        minh.pop();
        int d= minh.top();
        
        return (a*b)-(c*d);
    }
