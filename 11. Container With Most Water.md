The only intuition you need in order to approach the problem is when we have 2 lines side by side some distance apart, the smaller line will determine the area enclosed between them (like limiting reagent in chemistry lol).
But in simple terms, we can use 2 pointers, one at the start and another at end and see which one of them is smaller and calculate the area encloses, we then move the pointer of smaller and continue this till pointers clash. 

Here is the code with comments:




```
int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        
        int n= height.size();
        int area=0; //ans to be returned
        int i=0; //left pointer 
        int j= n-1; //right pointer
        
        while(i<j){   //run the loop till pointers don't meet
            if(height[i]< height[j]){   //if the length of left pointer is less
                area= max(area, (height[i]* (j-i)));  //we only keep the maximum area with us
				// we simply use that as length in the (length * breadth) formulae of area of rectangle.
				// breadth is difference between their indexes
                i++;  // increase the pointer
            }
            else{  //if the right pointer has lower length
                area= max(area, (height[j]* (j-i))); //(length*breadth) only length here is taken from the right pointer and breadth remains the difference between indexes
                j--; //reduce the pointer
            }
            
        }
        
        return area; // return the max area
    }
