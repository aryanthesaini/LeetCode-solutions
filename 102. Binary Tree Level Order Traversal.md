I personally think that any video based tutorial would be far better to understand what exactly happens in level order traversal of a tree. But I will try and explain what is happening in my code. It is also really important to have a grasp on the concept of bfs to solve a number of other problems so kindly give it some time and try coding it by yourself as much as you can. 

We use the data structure queue, i.e, a FIFO (first in first out) type data structure which lets us access the front element one at a time. In simple terms we just push the root node in our queue and run our loop till the queue is empty. Then we pick up the front element from our queue and in processing it, we add its value to a temporary vector and check if there exists a left or right subtree for this particular TreeNode, if it does, we push them in the queue and continue the process. 
For every iteration, 's' determines the number of elements in a given level and as soon as 's' is exhausted we push our temporary vector into ans and clear it. 

Code:

```
vector<vector<int>> levelOrder(TreeNode* root) {
        if(!root) return {};
        vector<vector<int>>ans;
        
        
        queue<TreeNode*>q;
        q.push(root);
        while(!q.empty()){
            
            int s = q.size();
            vector<int>temp;
            while(s--){
                auto cur = q.front();
                q.pop();
                
                temp.push_back(cur->val);
                if(cur->left) q.push(cur->left);
                if(cur->right) q.push(cur->right);
                
            }
            ans.push_back(temp);
            temp.clear();
        }
        
        return ans;
        
    }
