An intuition that can make this problem relatively easy to solve, is that if we sort the points given to us by their ending time[X-end], and we observe that they never overlap, we can simply return the number of points available to us, because we will have to use atleast those many arrows to burst them all.

So we can sort and as we go along, keep a check on the latest element we encounter and if the i-th element does not overlap, we increase our answer by 1, else we continue. Have a look at the commented code for a better understanding:

```
static bool comp(vector<int>&v1, vector<int>&v2){
        return v1[1] < v2[1];  //compare function to sort based on the first index
    }   
    

int findMinArrowShots(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        int n = points.size();
        if(points.size()<2) return n;  //if there are 0 or 1 elements, we can simply return the size

        sort(points.begin(), points.end(), comp);  //sort based on the first index
        int ans = 1;
        int prev = points[0][1];  //store the first X-end value
        
        
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++){
            if(points[i][0] <= prev)  //if the value of current point lies within the previous, we simply continue
             continue;
			 
            ans++;  //the current and previous points don't overlap so we increase our answer
            prev = points[i][1];  // and modify our previous stored X-end with current
        }
        return ans;
    }
```
