I will briefly discuss 2 approaches for this problem, i.e, bfs and recursive. Both of them are pretty intuitive and I will provide code with proper comments to help you understand them better. 

The recursive approach for this problem is very self explainatory in nature. We simply check if any one of the provided trees is empty, and return false if that is the case. If they are both empty on the other hand, we return true, this makes our base case. 
In our recursive case, we compare the values of given trees and call the function for their respective sub-trees and return true if all the values are same. 
Here is the code for the same:



#### Recursive code
```
 bool isSameTree(TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if(p==NULL or q==NULL){
            if(p==q) return true;  //if both of them are null we return true as they are same
            else return false;  //if only one of them is null we return false
        }
        if(p->val == q-> val and isSameTree(p->right, q->right) and isSameTree(p->left, q->left))
            return true;  //if all subtrees have same values, we return true;
			
        else return false;  //else we return false
    }
```

BFS or level order traversal can be used to simply iterate over both the trees and compare every individual value. It follows the same logic, i.e, if one of them is null while comparing, we return false, if both are null, we consider it same. 
The code provided below will help you understand better what is happening:

#### Using BFS:
 ```
   bool isSameTree(TreeNode* a, TreeNode* b) {
   
        queue<TreeNode*>q;
        q.push(a);
        q.push(b);  //push the root elements of both trees in the queue
        
        while(!q.empty()){
            auto tempfirst= q.front();  //this stores elements for first tree
            q.pop();
            auto tempsecond = q.front(); //elements for second tree
            q.pop();
            
            if(tempfirst==NULL and tempsecond==NULL) continue; //when both are null we can simply continue as they are same
            if(tempfirst==NULL or tempsecond ==NULL) return false; //when one of them is null, we return false as they are not equal
            if(tempfirst->val!= tempsecond->val) return false; //when the values are different we simply return false
           
            q.push(tempfirst->left);  //standard bfs procedure for first tree
            q.push(tempsecond->left);  //standard bfs procedure for first tree
            q.push(tempfirst->right);
            q.push(tempsecond->right);
            
        }
     
        return true;  // return true if all conditions satisfied
    }
```
