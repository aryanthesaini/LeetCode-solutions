In the simplest of terms, when we check if 2 strings s1 and s2 are anagrams of each other, we see that every character in the string s1 occurs the exact number of times in string s2.
So the first observation is simply to check and return false if s1 and s2 are not of the same length. 
If the length is same, we simply create a map that can store the frequency of characters in a string, i.e, map<char,int> type and iterate over both the strings at the same time and in every iteration we increase the value corrosponding to character in string s1 in our map and reduce the value corrosponding to character in s2 from our map. 
By the end of this iteration if the 2 strings are anagrams of each other, we would have have an empty map as every addition to the value from first string would be reduced to zero by a subtraction from the second string. 

Here is the code with comments:

```
bool isAnagram(string s, string t) {

	if(s.length()!= t.length()) return false;  // we check the basic condition comparing lengths
	unordered_map<char,int>m;  

	for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++){
		m[s[i]]++;   //iterate over and add value to map
		m[t[i]]--;   //iterate and reduce value from the map
	}

	for(auto itr:m){ 
		if(itr.second) return false;  // even if there is a single element left in our map we return false
	}
	return true;   //else we return true
	
}
```
